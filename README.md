# game-n-code
*I want you to teach yourself game theory in a programming language, by coding the exercise in your own native lang (i.e. lang you feel at ease to express your self). I write in Racket/Scheme (LISP) and some other langs I am learning. Contribute your own solution and feel free to speak up if you see something deserved to be said*
