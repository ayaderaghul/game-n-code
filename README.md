# game-n-code
*I want you to teach yourself game theory in a programming language, by coding the exercise in your own native lang (i.e. lang you feel at ease to express your self). I write in Racket/Scheme (LISP) and some other langs I am learning. Contribute your own solution and feel free to speak up if you see something deserved to be said*

## Nash equilibrium
*The best way to convey the message is probably through an example. The details are chosen carefully to transmit a substantial amount of knowlege.*

Nash equilibrium is an intuitive concept. Consider my way of explaining it here and see how well it goes with your intuition. This is the semantic way of teaching fundamental concepts in game theory and in evolved (programming) languages.

This chapter has three parts: to explain the theory, to explain it in code, and your own solution. This lesson needs you to be completed, I pay my part of the bargain. I wish you to bring you to the table.
